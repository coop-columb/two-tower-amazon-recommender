# Environment Status Report

## Current Configuration
- Virtual Environment: Active
- Python Version: 3.11.7  
- Development Tools: Installed
- Project Structure: Basic directories created
- Git Branch: feature/data-pipeline-foundation

## Validated Working Commands
- source activate_dev.sh (environment activation)
- black src/ tests/ (code formatting)
- isort src/ tests/ (import sorting)
- flake8 src/ tests/ (linting)
- pytest tests/ -v (testing)

## Terminal Stability Issues
- Avoid complex shell operations
- Use manual VS Code setup via GUI
- Reference dev_commands.txt for safe commands
- Use Jupyter alternative if needed

## Development Workflow
1. Activate environment: source activate_dev.sh
2. Open VS Code manually via GUI  
3. Use integrated terminal for development
4. Reference dev_commands.txt for operations
5. Commit changes using basic git commands

## Next Steps
- Begin data pipeline implementation
- Use conservative shell operations
- Test each new command individually
- Document any additional crash triggers
