# Two-Tower Amazon Recommender System

Production-ready two-tower recommendation model implementation using Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset with comprehensive MLOps infrastructure.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a state-of-the-art two-tower architecture for product recommendation using the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset. The system demonstrates enterprise-level ML engineering practices with complete data processing pipelines, model training infrastructure, and production serving capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Raw Data → Processing Pipeline → Two-Tower Model → Serving Infrastructure

### Core Components

- **Data Pipeline**: HuggingFace integration with advanced preprocessing
- **Model Architecture**: TensorFlow Recommenders two-tower implementation
- **Training Infrastructure**: Distributed training with experiment tracking
- **Serving System**: FastAPI with approximate nearest neighbor search
- **MLOps**: Comprehensive CI/CD with automated testing and deployment
